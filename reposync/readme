-- REPOSITORIES --

System must be connected to RHN in order to download redhat packages.

-- USAGE --

Grab latest packages:

  $ ./update.sh

  - creates <timestamp>-<reponame>-before.list containing packages existing in the repository
  - creates <timestamp>-<reponame>-after.list containing packages after the update was performed
  
  In order to see which packages are new, perform:

    $ diff before.list after.list | grep \>

Create a directory containing only new packages:

  $ ./package.sh <timestamp>

  - Generates a directory for each repo that was updated at <timestamp>
  - Copies new packages from repo into <timestamp> directory structure
  - Allows a subset of packages to be copied to another host

Create burnable tarball of new packages:

  $ ./package-tar.sh <timestamp>
  
  - Creates 500m tarballs in <timestamp> directory for ease of burning to CD/DVD media
  - Tarballs numbered from 0001, 0002, ... n
  - To extract tarballs, use the following command:
    $ cat timestamp*.tar.* | tar xvf -
  - Once tarballs have been generated, packages within <timestamp> directory can be removed
  
Create repo on another host:

  - extract all tarballs into current directory (steps above)
  - will create a directory structure <repository>/<packages>
  
  $ createrepo <repository>
  
  - Creates metadata about packages for use as a repository
  - Create /etc/yum.repos/rhel6-rhn.repo that links to correct directory
  - Perform "yum makecache", then "yum install"
    
Download packages:

  - downloads packages and dependencies
  - creates approximate directory structure for loading into repos
  - recommended to run in temporary directory as to not corrupt repos
  - specify package name in the form <name>-<version>.el6 
  
  $ mktemp -p . -d
  $ download.sh <package>
  $ download.sh --source <package>
